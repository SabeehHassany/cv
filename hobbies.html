    <h3>What I like to do</h3>
    <ol type='i'>
        <li><strong>Fly</strong></li>
        <p>I made this first website while on a plane ride from NYC to Dubai. Which is why I put this as one of the things I like to do!</p>
        <li><strong>Read</strong></li>
        <p>Reading is a great way for me to learn interesting things about the world and pass some time as well.</p>
        <li><strong>Play Music</strong></li>
        <p>I have a trusty piano and ukelele that I've been teaching myself for the past few months. It's been a blast</p>
